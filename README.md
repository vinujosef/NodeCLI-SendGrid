# NodeCLI-SendGrid
Node CLI App for sending email using SendGrid API

This is an interactive command line application built using Node JS, and with the help of SendGrid API we will send emails to a list of users.

Once the application loads :
* it will output the list of users to whom the email will be send
* ask sender's email, name and subject of mail as input


In this program, the list of users to whom the email should be send is saved in Input -> employees.csv

## Usage

* Enter the command : node broadcast.js -l input/employees.csv
* Type in as input sender's email, name and subject of the mail


## NOTE:
The API key used here is not valid anymore, so kindly create an new API key.
