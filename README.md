# NodeCLI-SendGrid
Node CLI App for sending email using SendGrid API

This is an interactive command line application built using Node JS. With the help of SendGrid API, the app will send emails to a list of users as specified in the "input/employees.csv" file.

Once the application loads :
* the list of users to whom the email will be send is printed (from "input/employees.csv" file)
* ask sender's email, name and subject of mail as input


## Usage

* Enter the command : node broadcast.js -l input/employees.csv
* Type in as input sender's email, name and subject of the mail


## NOTE:
The Sendgrid API key used here should be changed with a new one.
